## Superdeflector
Contains a passive TsAGI deflector (ring) and a turbo deflector (or wind mill) above TsAGI deflector deflector.
Turbodeflector installed above TsAGI deflector, and improves total efficiency of ventilation.

Air flow ~ sqrt(delta(P))
DeltaP - difference of pressure
so if you increase pressure inside TsAGI deflector with turbo deflector - you will get more air flow.
